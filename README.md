I am a full stack software developer with an enthusiastic interest in the way AI has been shaping the future of humankind, especially in regard to decision making processes and how humans experience free will. With experience working in TypeScript, Java and AWS Archicture, examples of my projects can be found below.

I have a pretty diverse background, from doing a BSc in Science and Humanities and then a BA in Philosophy, to working in the baking industry, to moving abroad and doing volunteer work for a blind people charity, to developing mobile and web apps. Throughout these jobs I have always done my best to deliver high quality end produts. I like to follow the Pareto rule when organising my workday, focusing on the 20% piece of work that returns most of the results and automating the rest.
